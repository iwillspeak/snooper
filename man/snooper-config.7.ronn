snooper-config(7) - Configure for Espionage
===========================================

## DESCRIPTION

Configuration of `snooper` is controlled through a YAML file.

## FORMAT

snooper(1) expects a YAML document of key-value pairs; each pair specifies an 
option. Unknown options are ignored. Options that can contain a list of values
may also be given a single value.

## OPTIONS

 * `base_dir:` <directory>:
   Specifies the <directory> that `snooper` should base all relative paths from.
   This is also the working directory that commands will inherit.

 * `paths:` <directories>:
   Specifies a list of <directories> to watch. Directories can be either 
   relative or absolute paths. If no paths are specified the default is to 
   watch `base_dir`.

 * `filters:` <filters>, `ignore:` <filters>:
   Specifies a list of regular expressions <filters> to use to filter the
   changes. These should be in a format understood by ruby(1)'s Regex.new
   method. If none are given then all changes in watched directories trigger
   testing.
   
   _Note_: as these are regular expressions `\.c` will match both
   `foo.c` and `bar.cfg`, `\.c$` will only match `.c` files.
