#Snooper

Snooper is a lightweight test automation tool, it monitors files and folders while you work and re-runs your tests when you change something. Snooper doesn't care what language you're using or what framework you are testing with, it's all configureable.

##Useage

```bash
$ snooper <directory> <command>
```

See [snooper(1)](man/snooper.1.html) for more information.
